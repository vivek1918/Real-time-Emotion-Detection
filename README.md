*Real-time Emotion Detection using OpenCV and Deep Learning -*
Developed a real-time emotion detection system using OpenCV and FER (Facial Expression Recognition) library. 
The system captures webcam feed, detects facial emotions, and displays emotion percentages using bounding boxes around detected faces. 
Implemented camera resolution and quality adjustments to enhance detection accuracy.
